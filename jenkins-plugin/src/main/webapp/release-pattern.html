<p>
    Release pattern describes which branches are considered as release.
    Use '%' to denote version number. For example: <pre style="display:inline">release/%</pre>.
    Plugin properly support versions. Last merge always happens to master.
    Using example config, merge should happen in the following order:
    <p>
        <pre>
            release/1.9  ->  release/1.10  ->  release/2.0  ->  master
        </pre>
    </p>
</p>
