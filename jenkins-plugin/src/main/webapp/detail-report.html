    Detail report shows more details about conflict and makes easier to decide which developer has most knowledge for
    those conflicts.
    Report is reported as exception message.
    If you want publish report somewhere, you should catch exception first and publish its message.
</p>
<p>
    You could limit number of authors and commits for report.
    Large limits are not recommended for large teams and code-bases.
    Zero of commit limit means only author lines will be reported.

<p>
    An example of report:
</p>
<p>
    <code>
        Changes of Author3 cause total 8 lines of conflicts:<br/>
        - Commit 2afcbc1 causes 8 lines of conflicts with message: Change b<br/>
        Changes of Author2 cause total 6 lines of conflicts:<br/>
        - Commit 2afcbc1 causes 6 lines of conflicts with message: Change a<br/>
        Changes of Author1 cause total 2 lines of conflicts:<br/>
